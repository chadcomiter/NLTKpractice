1I will never tell my kid how much money I managed to lose in the greatest bull run in history
2Support group for everyone too poor to FOMO about TeslaKeep in mind too poor in this context means doesnt have literally tens of thousands to buy a single call
3Today hurt Upvote if you were up a large amount in the morning and ended down a large amount Comment for emotional support
4FOMO all in on TSLA fuck your valuations this thing has two booster rockets on its ass
5Dropping my entire net worth 20k into TSLA 7/17 1750c at open and wont look at it until the end of the day lmao fuck itGood luck all

9Why cant I just wake up at 929am My brain always has too much fucking BULLISH excitement that it wakes me up at 7 on mondays to slowly suffer before my hot tendies 
10I didnt even realize i had bought an 8/14 TSLA 2000 uppie on Friday i also thought the 1600 uppie I had bought was for 7/17 not 7/24 i gotta stop getting stoned during the day
11Ahhh Tesla Im gonna keep hating myself for not buying and Im gonna hate myself when I do finally buyat the tippy top 
12So Tesla just skipped the 1600s basically
13- 20 million unemployed- biggest debt bubble ever- crumbling relations with China- global pandemicSpy near ATH
14You could have literally bought the top on Friday for TSLA and still be up bigly
15Dipped outta AMZN up 26k today
16Still bull gang but holy shit this market is really starting to get irrational
17I dont think people appreciate Jerome Powell enoughDo you know how difficult it is to create a stock market bubble like this? Now imagine doing it DURING A RECESSION He basically pulled off something most people thought was impossible Getting investors to buy into businesses at record valuations as earnings are shitting the bed No other fed chair in history has ever pulled anything remotely close to this and this really may be the last time we see something like this We are witnessing history fellas
18Do you know how the bulls drive their new teslas?They steer them
19Omg It happened Im rich WTF It took 10 fucking years and it happened Omg

30Made money as a bull today Sometimes its good to take wins and not wait for a 10 bagger
31TSLA may become the biggest bubble of our entire lives
32Was eating animal crackers and was thinking about buying aapl calls I thought God I need a fucking sign and I shit you not the next animal cracker I pulled out was a bull AAPL 400c
33TSLA tendies for the kids https//imgurcom/a/I1dsNuS
34VIX spiking SPY mooning Danger zone
35What??? Were having a lunchtime selloff? This is a new occurrence thats never happened before in history
36Everybody engage diamond hands Even if you have 7/17 youll be fine These tech dips that happen across the board are either the market pricing in future movements bank reports tomorrow or rotation taking place by MMs trying to maximize their gains and prevent huge run ups that force them to delta/gamma hedgeJust calm down hold your shit and youll be fine Also BTFD
37I grabbed a 7400 grab from Tesla today from FridayI am so happy I took the win&x200BI took a screen shot and the saying popped in my head&x200BIf it was nice enough to screen shot its nice enough to cash outso I did and Im happy AF&x200BHit an Amazon on a day trade for 2 G
38Vix rising and SPY rising was a tell sign this was gonna happen
39That last time I fomod with SPY 330 calls we dumped 5 the next day I will take a bullet for the team and not FOMO
40Now for the big question sell at open and buy the dip or hold because the euphoria is too strong to dip
41If you have a pet parrot and dont teach it to say Help The fuckers turned me into a parrot then you have missed an opportunity
42Apple price target raised to 419 by Morgan Stanley Why not 420????

44CNBC ran an article about students in USA getting sicker from coronavirus than students in other countries with the obvious reason being that kids in the USA on average are fatter and therefore are more likely to also have diabetes asthma etcbut all the comments and twitter replies are just bullshit fake news quit pushing the shutdown narrativejust in case you thought people in america might be taking the pandemic seriously
45TSLA dipped again Just bought more Idc if I gain or lose I just want to feel something again
46AAPL                         WMT                Making tendies for me

49So everything hinges on JPM earnings It is widely regarded as the most stable and well diversified bank of the lot at the moment If JPM earnings are reasonably stable we are going to have one ripper of a day Otherwise lube up at open
50 bulls like I was up 20 now Im at -84 what happened
51WSB is bullish af Hard to inverse yall today but it hasnt failed me yet
52If anyone is hoping for a march like fall that wont happen Thats a once in a 5-10 years eventBut if coronavirus keeps exponentially growing in the US all the sectors that will actually be impacted by it will continue to do poorly for the foreseeable future Which could easily bring on a prolonged recession So long tech because coronavirus isnt going away anytime soon
53Holy shit everything is up bigly
54COVID CanceledVaccine waiting on approval October to produce 1 billion worldwide PFE and BNTX

56TSLA call holders Make sure you stay hydrated I know yall are sweating bullets right now I know i am

58Im a bull but wtf is going on still 
59Apparently the super secret cheat code to making money in this market is buy calls on literally anything

714k gain to 6k loss  Brutal afternoon  im cash gang and still in the green give me a YOLO if the banks shit the bed in the AM
72Dont worry bulls This is just a fag trap
73So this means the only reason TSLA stopped going up on Friday is because it had no choice since the market closed I wonder what it would have closed at if we had a 16hr trading day or something
74She said where we goingI said the moon
75I feel like ppl all over the world are gobbling up on TSLA I have friends in asia that say everyone in their country say TSLA is a 5k stock EVEN SOME FUCKING ANALYSTS
76God the most boring fucking plays are the ones that workTried playing earnings on Walgreens and Bed Bath got fucked Tried a few NIO plays mostly bad timingBuy month-out ATM AAPL calls and hold over the weekend? Yeah Its going to print Of course its going to print its the most boring play of all time

83Both SPY and VIX up bigly from open? Susp

90everything is bigly green but MSFT is still sleeping fucking do something
91Its 8 am do you know where your tendies are?
92Time to start betting against stay at home stocks and more on reopening? I think optimism around reopening is starting to rise again even with the spike in cases We may have actually done a good enough job securing supplies and increasing hospital capacity that the spike is managed this time
93Anyone looking at real estate now?All this fed liquidity is comical even housing is skyrocketing during double digit unemployment Next generation is pretty much all going to be homeless they are absolutely fucked

128people dont know what else to buy so they buy TSLA  hence why price keeps going up we can all buy for quick gains atm but just need to be careful people who bought in early will be happy to take profits at any time if things start to look bad

Personally I wouldve loved watching pokimane get the robinhood opening bell sweats and waste a bunch of simp money live Cest la vie Im checking out for the day since this has been a shitshow Good luckPlus none of those tards wouldve been able to post for a month or so anyway And the burden is on us to moderate it We always get the best posts from complete noobs with too much money They rarely bring 100k

576Guys nothing gets a girl going more on a first date than talking about your short positions with over-leveraged margin  I usually bring a few towels to throw on the ground throughout the date because I dont want to get sued for her slipping and breaking her leg from getting so wet over my hearing about my trades

578Dont forget what happening in the beginning of June where we had a similar sector rotation into the travel industry only to be left in shambles a few days later due to the market all of sudden becoming rational again that covid isnt going anywhere anytime and that the vaccine news was just a pump and dump once again by MRNA Realistically we wont have a vaccine until 2021-2022 latest Dont load up on leaps for travel just yet or youll be stuck bag holding get in make a quick profit and get out back into the one true safe haven tech until this covid bs is over &x200Bthanks for coming to my Ted Talk

826Love the articles about tech being overvalued and being a bubble Exactly where the fuck are folks supposed to invest their money in the stock market during a pandemic where lockdown is necessary and travel restrictions are at a high? Disney? Airlines? Cruises? Nope investing in companies that excel during these times is a bad idea Big boys must be working overtime to get the media to write these shitty articles
827Tomorrow is green calling it now no one give a fuck about Twitter
828Cheap TWTR calls hopefully Remember when FB mooned to nearly 250 just days after companies were pulling ads?Yeah I dont think the big boys care about the hacker known as 4chan
829Futures green too early fuck man
830Big boys got all their buddies in the media sector to write headlines saying is it over for tech? All you need to know are big boys are itching to buy tech back at low prices so they can play earnings Its painfully obvious Notice all the vaccine hype and tech doom and gloom stuff? Buy the tech dip preferably non weeklies

844Realizing how big of a deal the Twitter hack is commented on another post already- but hacking a twitter account is essentially stealing that persons voice for a brief moment in time It seems they stayed clear of officials in office because that could maybe have been construed as an act of war or something but imagine if they wanted to sow chaos- they could easily destroy a business ruin an economy maybe start a war

1077Historically what really happens to a company stock when its added to the S&P500? Is there ever a sudden spike? People betting on Tesla getting a bump when added to S&P500 seems too good to be true  like the quad witching nonsense Is it possible this would actually initiate a sell off since it would no longer be in meme territory?

1101If youre still trying to make fundamental PE work in your stock picks youre doing it wrongThe market is up for one reason the dollar is being devalued and your savings account API is a fucking insultCash is a losing proposition right now  Real estate is possible but with 32 or American households delinquent its not liquid enough to bail out on if it very probably goes tits upBrrrr is right but not for the reason the tards think  Brrrr is diluting the dollar and forcing individuals into the market so they dont get clappedGrowth stocks? Value stocks?  Its all bullshit  The second a viable alternative appears as a safe haven for cash well pop  Until then youll still have buyers for AAPL at any price  The only enemy of your calls right now is sector rotation

1110The amount of influence WSB has on certain stocks is often understated Wouldnt be surprised to learn that folks working for big hedge funds snoop around here looking for underbought tickers People pretend that hedge funds are comprised of finance gurus when in reality theyre just a bunch of trust funds babies who do a shit ton of guesswork in nice Tom Ford suits

1146So my wife and I have been through a lot of struggles over the past few years and we finally decided to go to couples therapy to work on some stuff before we had kids She had it in her head that a lot of the issues between us stemmed from me and the therapist has literally directed 99 of those conversations and recommendations towards her Literally almost entirely Dont want to celebrate But I would be a liar if I didnt say it was highly amusing The therapist almost verbatim recommends things Ive been saying for years Its hilarious to me though Im really happy because the entire experience is definitely going to pay dividends for us But talk about how things didnt go the way she thought
1147Ok so ive come to the conclusion that Theta Gang and Kang Gang joined forces this week to rape us all But come on it was obvious the market was going to behave this way July 17th options were amongst one of the most popular options ever bought in the HISTORY of Options Trading They needed to slow down the rocket Refuel the ink cartridge ane blast off for next week BULL GANG STAND YOUR GROUND

1201Can I ask you guys a question Why isnt there a movie called the big long?  Itd be about blue collar worker who buys stock in AAPL when hes super young after seeing an ad in his newspaper and then the stock goes up over 20 years and hes made more money and moved to a big houseIt would literally just be just him aging and watching TV ads about Apple and then watching more stuff like YouTube streams about the iPod iPad and smart watch  Camera fades out with him using an old school record player a Samsung phone and no Apple product in sight And then it ends with him being like I guess it pays to buy and hold
1202I need tech to not disappoint this week

1231Three basic principles I have stuck to lately that have greatly increased my options and trading gains  A great entry point is when RSI gets below 30/20/15  entry points over 30 variable  entry points over 70/80 ur retarded  MCAD breakout  buy on the SECOND candle after the cross over  1st candle can be a fake out and 4th candle and ur chasing  Enter a position on good news usually pays off  stocks ripping on no news are likely stock manipulation aka pump and dumps  best play on a PnD is wait for RSI of 80/90 and SHORT THE BITCH

1248I only got to watch half of the Big Short last night so Im finishing it now Really curious what happens to the housing market and to Goslings jacked tits Please no spoilers guys
1249Everyone is either staying at their homes fixing shit or people are buying cheap ass fixer uppers and are gonna spend an arm and a leg at Lowes and Home depot Literally cant go tits up
1250The fact that the news still talks about corona virus is all the reason to be a bull
1251Whats the best stock market movie besides wolf of Wall Street China hustle and the big short? Need some motivation
1252Elon received sloppy tophttps//deadlinecom/2020/07/elon-musk-amber-heard-johnny-depps-los-angeles-penthouse-1202988261/ from Amber Heard on the regular

1257Feels weird being a bull Only searching for positive news to support my Amazon calls and AZN calls Only good news I see is AZN lol  That report needs to be a breakthrough or really good to make Monday green as fuck
1258I dont know when I started doing dailies or weeklies like Im Kenny Fucking Powers I used to buy 2-3 weeks out Might go back to that The news cycles and constant bullshit make it very hard to want to hold anything overnight I dont want a relationship with the stock I want in & out like a whore house

1262The fortune cookie I got with my General Tsos chicken readsDo not fright bulls delightThe name of the restaurant? Wie Ken Dao Coincidence? I think not Hotel? Trivago
1263Honestly the market is so dependent on the Fed a vaccine might really fuck it upThe bulls were right in their joking its feeding on the problemsA solution might derail efforts to pump if it comes at a disruptive time  Spark price discovery
1264Is tech big going to rebound this week
1265This shit on this sub is so funny Bulls are so full of bullshit
1266Way too bullish on AZN and MRNA in here Dont be greedy some bullshit is afoot
1267Im starting to think that r/nikolacorporation is more delusional and retarded than hertz bulls after reading some of their posts
1268How many can relate to that feeling when you hit it big and then that feeling when you lose it all?
1269Dont forget about the weekly AMZN moon mission on Monday
1270How green will SPY be on Monday? White House will be receiving/reporting all covid case numbers moving forward instead of the CDC so numbers will invariably go down Sounds bullish
1271All in AZN and SPY calls for Monday either Im bigly fucked or bigly rich 
1272AZN make me or break me monday Ill prob buy an AZN shirt or something if it moons
1273Tf happened to NKLA?

1285Jesus Christ were April earnings actually 3 months ago? What the fuck happened?
1286When does AZN news release on monday? Im holding a call debit spread and max profit is capped at 64 because i didnt expect it to run so much
1287With central banks propping everything up all the action in the currency markets now

1294Spotify is not even done Analysts can suck my 2 inch pp I believe in them and the future of podcasts and as a future rival to YouTube Once they add videos comment sections will be next and so on basically turning into an early version of YouTube when it was actually fun for creators
1295Is any other pharma co announcing results soon? If AZN if the last for a while after Monday FOMO that may be the end for the vac pump I thought for sure it would be over by now  Maybe people know the winner will be clear soon and want to go long shares of their guess at the first approved vaccine
129622k total on 3 trades that I held for 40ish min cumulativeRode fsly 2x 80c 7/17 Rode nflx 525 7/24Take tendies fast guyz
1297Ill never make tendies just gonna stick to chicken McNuggets
1298You know why SPY is facing a brick wall at 323 with deceasing volume??? There arent enough buyers to break thru it because they think its a risky trade right now and need more vindication that it isnt so whats it gonna take breach this resistance? Believe it or a DUMP to the next strong support level and then a strong bounce off of it WITH VOLUME this tells next potential entrants that there are buyers supporting these levels and that they can enter with confidence for next leg up  reason why we dump Monday/Tuesday after 7 weeks of going nowhere  think we dump a bit trade in the lower range of current resistance and support and with major earnings coming up that decides whether we hold support and bounce up or existing holders dump and we test new lower supports
1299Gonna read some books and work on my Chiron while sipping a rare diet KO
1300which added that jobs were also cut in the Microsoft Azure cloud divisionMsft going to shit itself in earnings Question is will it pull a complete nflx -10 or will it find support at 190?

1306Just ran out to grab some tamales & menudo Im set for the day Trying to support these places before they close forever
1307What happens when a companys dividend yield goes over 100?
1308Whats the case for bullish Tech earnings in Q2?
1309If AZN vaccine not distributed for profit then how stock gonna moon??
1310I dont think we havent priced in AZN positive results I mean imagine if you are a big boi With lot of insider info and back channels and a hell lot of money to make Wont you price in such a development ahead of the result ? I am seeing increasing amount of call holders solely based on that news here And that makes me wonder whether if thats already priced in
1311Who else playing cruise and airline calls Hoping for a big next week so I can break even

1326War with China- China is all talk no fight  The principal of the The Art of War  Misdirection play up your weakness hide your strength- Chinese culture is pretty whatever  As long as life goes on they dont really care if an aggressor takes over  Has happened many times in their history  They have some saying China consumes from the inside or something and its true  You cant change China China changes you- They dont respond well to embarrassment  A bigger win would be to pants the CCP- they cut deals  If you ever worked over there theyll group up but if you get them alone in a room they sell each other out  Just take the highest ranking general and tell him he can emigrate and his kids can go to Harvard if he jumps in your back jet and disappears  Hell sell out in a second
1327Im glad Dr Fauci is there being a voice of reason and trying to get the world  through this  hard to believe he is 79 with all the big dick energy he has an american hero

1334If AZN hits and SPY opens above 325 Monday Mary Trump gonna be writing another book about how good this green dick was
1335Not a YOLO but I think JPM is in a good position to have a huge run up Not sure about short-term potential but I think 140 LEAPs might be a reasonable bullish bet
1336Man I just want these big funds to dump their bags on all the unsuspecting people so they get a taste of reality Too many dummies in the market these days

1356Its ok AMZN rest for now We have a big day tomorrow
1357I want to short so bad but i have a feeling were gonna get through 325 like we did 295 and have like 6 green days in a row
1358My entire portfolio is greennnnnnI started the day at -10 all time to now 4 all timeIts not much but Im finally fucking positive
1359Msft gonna run up till Wednesday and then sell off into close in earnings anticipation Itll miss go down to 197 and then start the moon mission over again
1360TSLA is absolutely parabolic Right at 1500 bought two 2000 calls 07/31 Sold at 1590 and now am back in on one 1700 EOD Wednesday 1800/1850 after earnings 2000 on the FOMO by EOD Friday Then maybe a 1500 put bc cmon this is the biggest bubble in the market 
1361AMZN saving my bull ass today Bald fraud Bezos is my hero
1362210 is now support for msft
1363Bears stay strong We are proud and we can read stock articles on google Gather the carcass of your brethren The time is soon Basic math says we cant all be rich buying stocks because they only go up They go downtoo and thats to happen soon The bulls here are making oink oink sounds and they forget that bulls have to sell to make money
1364For everyone asking WhAt HaPpEnEd TsLahttps//wwwmarketwatchcom/story/teslas-sp-500-inclusion-is-done-deal-for-bulls-analyst-says-2020-07-20This guy either cucks everyone or just priced in the earnings report
1365Yr daily reminder that the game is rigged We all know the eco is fucked Doesnt mean your puts will print or the black swan is imminent play along for free tendies
1366Making money should NOT be this easybought both Amazon & Tesla calls last week when it dipped
1367Honestly generous AF that tsla takes little pit stops inbetween moon missions to let us hop on
1368My biggest fear is that we get a trump tweet about the market today
1369No positions but incoming face ripping rally eod
1370AMZN another green day tomorrow?
1371MSFT getting upgraded by several analcysts before ER Classic pump and dump MSFT will probably disappoint
1372In an effort to go green this year Ive started to re use my condoms
1373GG bulls nobody ever worked harder to pass 323  You earned it  Free axe body spray Jell-O shots and cargo shorts for all you motherfuckers  Courtesy of the mods
1374The Corona virus briefings are back Super bullish Calls on bleach and happiness

1376ive decided im going to lose 7 grand on tsla calls bc i cant sit by and watch it rocket again with out me 99 sure im going to lose the money but i dont give af bc watching it moon with out me is even worse in some fucked up way
1377So TSLA 2K is basically happening with the earnings report isnt it?
1378So uhabout that bubble  Whens it popping again?
1379WMT up 015 mooning
1380Bears would stand in front of a broken ATM that was spitting out money and refuse to pick any of it up claiming it was actually fake and shouldnt be happening
1381I love the market just shitting all over NKLA while tech and EV go to the moon today 
1382Bros I came up with my own conspiracy theoryIf youre a big tech company youre really benefiting from the virus like a mofo without it youre going to be holding the bag of slow growth  You now have a captive audience stuck at home that needs to come to you for work deliveries entertainment ect  everything locked in  Even the Government is throwing big contracts at you to help trace people and give you more access to personal data  You also have a great ability to control the news and informationDo you want this thing fixed?  Nah   Huge conflict of interest?  Yeah
1383Rug pull feels so imminent I closed out my bullish positions and went mostly cash No pump on great vaccine news is concerning to me Gonna sit this one out for a minute and not lose any money may not make money either
1384I called AMZN and TSLA over the weekend Even had plays planned out Didnt pull the trigger on either Gut punch  But I lost a good bit last week and I need to just monitor and not jump in If anything today I learned the more you sit cash and not always involved in a play the better ready you are for future opportunities
1385NIKLA down big today and now worth LESS than Ford You hate to see it All 4 NIKLA employees are probably in shambles today Thoughts and prayers
1386Got in a TSLA 7/24 2k call at the dip tendies are pouring
1387All the stocks I didnt buy the dip on \moons\All the stocks I did buy the dip on \continues to crater or bleed\
1388Lol cant believe TSLA is still rocketing
1389Ugh Got stupid shitfaced for my 29th birthday this weekend Aint done that in a while Woke up at 10am to my phone saying alarm missed And most my short positions down bigly Cuts all over my right arm and shoulder My glasses only had one lens in them I vaguely remember lending out my bicycles for a ride to the river around 3am All the bikes are back home in a pile so thats goodAnd I guess roll my stupid AZN calls since itll cheap and theyre totally guh gonna go back up Keeping the faith in my UPS 8/14 125c Spce ya that was probably retarded FOMO I know better than this
1390Face ripping rally
1391The vaccine news was real and a big deal But the imagination of a vaccine five months in the future isnt enough to overcome the weight of cases in reality today Also unemployment ending without a new plan is pretty bad for the health of the economy
1392Talk me out of buying MRNA calls before close todayDown 15 before a vaccine pump Fed meeting tomorrow with top 5 vaccine candidate players MRNA included Its down because one analyst who is bullish on MRNA said the stock is expensive Now its not as expensiveHow is this not a good play???
1393AI going full bull on QQQ is like a robot giving itself a blowjob

1399AMZN is my first 100 ever I usually sell and take profits when I get 15-25 profit on each trade if I make a profit Just a personal strategy instead of trying to win the lotteryBut its beautiful AMZN popped my 100 cherry7k and counting 2x AMZN Jul 24 20 3200 Call Bought at 35 each
1400Big squeeze someone really closed a multi billion dollar short position on big tech Probably a good time to ditch it
1401Just sold my MSFT so time for it to moon
1402Anybody else just follow one or two stocks and then bet big when that stock they believe in goes down? Really working well for me currently
1403TSLA green candles are psychotic lol
1404Were going to the motherfucking moon this weekCan we get a welfare check on Variation-SeparateYourselfFromYourMoney and all the other Beartards? 
1405I am pretty sure that most retail traders lose their hard earned money every month on buying options and holding till expMM and Theta love uSo obvious why JPM and GS crushed earnings due to their investment gains Collecting money from retail traders keeps the poor poor and riches richerChange my mind
1406If AZN ends green today Ill sell my ROPE

1463The VIX is dying NASDAQ has diverged from the movements of the broader market and FAAMG is going to the stratosphere before it has reported earnings We have AMZN at a PE ratio of \150 and I guarantee their earnings will disappoint Im not saying you should buy puts today as it could keep going up for another week or so but there has never been a more telegraphed blow off top all year than whats happening this week

1742Watching Tesla go back up because I sold my call at a loss and wouldnt be able to get back into the same position tomorrow   maybe my a amazon calls work out And or Msft doesnt dump who knows And if Im motivated Ill workout before going to work and endlessly updating my stock watchlistEdit Maybe Apple will move to 400 as well Probably not
1743SNAP in position to IV crush everyone because when will people learn to not hold through earnings
1744SNAP started last year at 5 and was up 5x since then at close today With an increase like that I expect them to crush their earnings and absolutely crush user growth The report today was good but it doesnt justify the 5x gain and/or gains in the near future imo Sub 20 by next week
1745Fuck you SNAP bulls how could you ever think holding through earnings would work This garbo stock should be at 13Yes still salty about losing 40 on puts a month ago

1751Top is in Rest In Pussy bulls
1752Powell Bans Gold Trading Urges SEC Probe Into Manipulated Market    In a stunning move  Jerome Powell has issued a countrywide ban on precious metals trading    Among reasons cited for the move the Fed noted the limited supply of precious metals which made the asset class fundamentally unfair to everyday investors and even morally bankrupt    Enough is enough a sweaty but altogether handsome Powell said during a press conference Due to its limited supply and capital appreciation potential this is an inherently dangerous market We have to step in to stop investors from buying the wrong securities We plan to implement a ban on precious metals trading    If investors want to put their money somewhere safe we have a place for that Its called treasury bonds    Powell continued The Fed sees no signs of excess or inflation in this market and anyone who disagrees  whether verbally or by buying heinous garbage like precious metals  should be shot on sightLMAO
1753So tell me Fucking tell me right now If you have 50 million invested in this market in the big boys like AAPL/MSFT/AMZN and you just saw SNAP take a fat shit everywhere and drag FB down with it   &nbsp  Are you keeping your money in for the rest of earnings?
1754Coronavirus was amazing fabulous for the stock market trump gonna convince his retarded ass fan base to start wearing masks actually helping to suppress the virus CB incoming

1756What are the chances that SNAP is green tomorrow? That sell off seems like an overreaction to me Their report was not bad Only thing was that they missed DAU expectations Beat EPS ARPU and ad rev as well Like wtf?

1760Im not trying to convince you to buy calls or puts or whatever but once 30 of the population has the antibodies for this virus it becomes more and more difficult to spread to the point where the virus will die out seasonally and come back in contained outbreaksWe need the vaccine for the older people that are more susceptible to the symptomsThe bigger issue in play rn in my opinion is escalation with China
1761You can give the market literally any news and within a matter of hours they will be bullish somehow
1762Tomorrow will be green

1794Cant go parabolic every day apparently
1795Okay how recently did this screwball nincompoop false dark messiah claim it wasnt a big deal?
1796Like others said shot will be more painful than the root canal itself Pain might be the least of your worries What you may not know is that its extremely time consuming Its not unheard of it can take 2 hours for a single session You may have to make multiple appointments between the root canal place and the place for crown if they are not at the same location Sometimes a total of 3 or more appointments may be needed Its expensive make sure you understand all the costs first Crown may be pain the in ass Sometimes they dont fit right They become uncomfortable to wear and chew food with Assuming you get to the end you are hoping theres no leakage around the crown If theres leak after 5-10 years your pain may return and you will need to go through this whole process again
1797well you might as well see what happens after their earnings tomorrow morning before you make the decision to sell

2028My favourite quote from Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds book from Charles MackayMoney again has often been a cause of the delusion of multitudes Sober nations have all at once become desperate gamblers and risked almost their existence upon the turn of a piece of paper To trace the history of the most prominent of these delusions is the object of the present pages Men it has been well said think in herds it will be seen that they go mad in herds while they only recover their senses slowly and one by one     In the present state of civilization society has often shown itself very prone to run a career of folly from the last-mentioned cases This infatuation has seized upon whole nations in a most extraordinary manner France with her Mississippi madness set the first great example and was very soon imitated by England with her South Sea Bubble At an earlier period Holland made herself still more ridiculous in the eyes of the world by the frenzy which came over her people for the love of Tulips

2469As soon as we break 321 were heading straight for the moon  I am basing this on absolutely nothing
2470Just a daily reminder that VIX is good for all of us It implies that the market will do more ups and downs which is how we make money on optionsIf you are one of those permabulls that cheers the death of vix you are literally cheering for the end of a once-in-a-lifetime gold rush and a return to neverending 002 days And that makes you a piece of shit and honestly you should be banned from WSB and the internet as a whole
2471Pop Smoke didnt die for this shit to happen smh
2472Drill team 6 is stretching for their final mission today Gonna be a long one but should finish the bulls off
2473There is going to be a big short squeeze today Get your calls at 1015
2474Something I am having a hard time understandingSo for months there was tech mania Everyone wanted to own MSFT and AAPL etc the prices just kept getting away from everyone and there was almost no value that was too highNow we finally get a break and an opportunity to own these amazing companies at a decent price and people end up selling even more? This makes no sense to me
2475Looks like i fucked up buying apple calls monday and yesterday
2476Ummm I was promised volatility suppression and the destruction of the dollar to buoy my retarded speculative investing decisionsWhat the frick man
2477why is fucking kang gang a thing? why cant it just be bull gang so we only go up and everyone gets money?
2478I shoulda held that TSLA put I bought yesterday The Volatility was sooo crazy As soon as it turned green I sold
2479Ok I guess Im once again averaging down my QQQ and apple calls
2480I cant believe I sold my MRNA puts for only a 50 gain yesterday Fucking stupid fake news vaccine bullshit nerds
2481The investment graveyard is full of bulls of momentum stocks who refused to see the turn in trend and held on in a hope for a return to the top Take your profits Tesla longs Dont let hope/greed fck you up
2482NET approaching 35 support Probabky a good entry for earnings
2483Marketing sinking with the dollar means bulls and stock owners are getting double teamed

2495Calls on bull tearsTrust me Ive got an inside source
2496Apple 400 8/21 calls  Free 
2497Beware bull brothers metals bonds going up with SPY
2498Conspiracy theory MMs/hedge funds/big money rig the market to purposely land the market at max pain every week to screw over as many small time investors as possible to force people to go back to workIm sure they know that theres a lot of new investors that are putting their stimulus money/unemployment in stocks and if they make money theres less of an incentive to go back to work
2499If we end up green today by some miracle act of toner Then Monday is going to be the greenest youve seen since microsoft launched windows xp with the bliss background

2543Having lost my ass buying puts in this rally Id really hoped I might feel like gloating as the bulls get crushed buying calls near the top But I dont Sorry guys It sucks You little bitty baby bitches
