5These last few months have basically been like wondering around a poorly lit casino like a drunk retard randomly hitting it big and equally as often nearly losing everything If the market crashes soon and I get kicked out of the casino for good at least I will have a hell of a story to tell my future broke kids and trailer park wife

7This market is fucking insane TSLA bears I actually feel bad for yall This one isnt even fair
8so TSLA gonna gain 100 every day until the day that I want to jump in calls Then it will tank 500 guaranteed
9Alright you morons VIX is not some magical number that is plucked out from the sky It weights the prices of out of the money calls and puts Basically if VIX goes up it means the MMs are hedging their positions with puts due to the uncertainty It doesnt necessarily mean everything is going to crash but does give you an indication that MMs are expecting it to fall

60Whoever times TSLA coming back to reality will be the richest man on this entire sub with all the tendies   Not even bearish but Elon himself said it was overvaluedand its since doubled lol cmon
61The hardest lesson to learn is that you dont need to trade every day You dont need to buy the at the very bottom or sell at the top You  need to take profits and sell losers Dont play the if I would have game If your account grows too big too fast its really easy for it to feel like fake money - so pull money from your account pay off credit cards or buy yourself a new dildo After a big win or loss take a day off or do a small trade I took my 5k account to 40k to 20k to 44k to 2k and now to 20k technically 10k since i took 10k out first time taking profits Edit first time taking money out of the investment account
62Remember those bears who had SPY 280 puts? They died

88I dont see any downside with WMT right now If corona continues then Walmart should do well everyone will want groceries delivered If corona ends soon people will return to WMT stores Its a win-win
89VIX looks ready to moonSPY looks ready to drop So probably 325 EOD

98I still for the love of god cannot believe you guys entered long positions with the intent of not swing trading when earnings are coming up and are expected to be insanely rockyIf you saw SPY at 320 in the morning and thought that looked delicious enough to buy into you deserve this
99Cmon fellas this one was predictable

104This is the fastest Ive ever seen WSB go from fully bullish to fully bearish
105This reminds me of the last month where we gapped up to 323 then immediately dropped to 315 and gapped down to 300 on the next day
106WSB turning bearish yall know what that means
107Cali closes meaning stay home and Netflix ahead of earnings which are rumored to be a big fat green dildo dumped  Can someone smarter than me explain?

111AMZN has so much more upside rn compared to TSLA since IV is still relatively low hence premiums arent insane
112I am so glad my spy 320 calls expired Friday thank you mm
113Get ready to all in on Tesla puts I am buying calls at open so it will tank at least 20
114So is the move to just buy puts on TSLA 3 minutes after open wait for it to drop 30 dollars then sell puts and buy calls? Seems to have worked out for the past week
115Hmmm Im a bull but I can feel bears dick pushing against my butthole hope Im wrong and its just my uncle joking around again

121Not gonna lie the IV on these Tesla puts are killer Getting raped even though its slowly dropping
122Amzn eow prediction? Can we see 3500?
123Cartel theory of the day now that they sold all their stocks over the last 3 months banks formed a pact to set earnings on same week then place horrendous losses on this report to tank market overnight before people can buy shorts
124We have literally recovered to January on spy
125its sector rotation when one sector drops while another climbs guys everything is climbing including vix
126TSLA making red candles faster than etsy
127Was up 25 on my whole portfolio this morning went back to sleep woke up a couple cents red 
128dont worry guys Elons just messing with the shorterswe needed more dead bears to hit 1800 today
129This is why bulls get slaughtered bears get slaughtered and kangs rule the world 
130What the fuck started this gay selloff
131FOMO bears going to get trapped weak handed bulls raped and brave dip buyers rewarded with tendies  A tale as old as time
132lmao calling this a selloff and we aint even red yet All these bulls think theyre the only geniuses who saw 323 retest before 330 on the chart while calling TA gay and saying stonks only go up Well they do until they dont That flavor in your mouth is hubris and its not even a real selloff the tilt is real
133I feel calmer with my portfolio getting massacred than this morning when I was holding onto 100 gains Peak autism bois
134I was right to be bearish on TSLA-Guy who shorted at 500 and doubled down at 700 900 1100 and 1200
135If today ends red it will be the first time we have a red Monday in 3 months
136AMZN with a 6 green to red movetotally normal market behavior  I fucking LOVE volatility
137Walmart you were supposed to destroy the bears not join them
138Just the mere thought of me quad reverse mortgaging my house so I could buy TSLA calls caused it to tank
139lmao the day I buy NET it drops 9
140What happens to most of you when you are margin called Do you just drop more cash into your account or are you just utterly fucked and delete the app?

142Guess Im gonna wait till tomorrow to see if stonks drop even further and buy moreEdit also I blame Tesla cunts for today

146Amzn just not slowing down At this point just get calls everytime its red and youll bank
147bears really do be fuk tho
148Everything mooning and my biggest bag Ddog is almost red I swear I chose the wrong shit everyday
149Trump is pumping on Biden memes Rip bears

154Mannn Im FOMOing so hard on TSLA I keep wanting to go in on it with everything but too scared
155Predictions TSLA will have almost daily moons until earnings TSLA  2000 by EOM
156So when TSLA is officially announced to be in the S&P 500 thats when the red days start do we agree?
1571 a day keeps the bears away
158be mebe the last bear leftswitching to calls im done
159Imagine being a gay bear today LOL 
160every red candleIs bought back instantly This is going to 3500 at least
161I would make 50k with a 5 drop
162thats not what bears meant when they said market is going to 270
163Imagine doing hours of extensive research and DD to find companies that you think have large amount of upside making sure not to buy too far OTM 5-10 only buying contracts with 45 DTE looking at the Greeks setting stop losses having an exit plan and you only end up making 20 gains over hundreds of trades throughout the yearThen some 18 year old with 2500 bucks to his name comes along and buys a 2500c expiring in 3 days on a stock that has already risen 50 in the last 5 days and makes your yearly salary in a single day
164POSTURE CHECKYou cant always predict the market but you can fix your posture
165Fellow Bears remember were not allowed to dance Were just supposed to get screamed at by Bulls about getting anal gaped three weeks straight and then very politely and quietly take our money on the rare red days
166JPM credit card earnings down 25 RIP consumer spending
167My favorite part of wallstreetbets is that the always cocky overconfident bulls talk shit to bears when the price goes up When price goes down the bears who are usually more quiet  talk mad shit back to bulls like a little brother thats always getting beat up but finally gets a good punch in
168Imagine being a confident TSLA call holder after seeing your stonk flash crash 5-10 twice in the past three trading sessions 1050p 7/17
169DD has disappeared on wsb thanks to Donald Pump and JPOW
170Its nice to see less fuk bears posts and more unorganized chaos as the market fucks us all into submission
171Theres someone on r/investing right now arguing with lots of people about whether unemployed people will cause the next crash when they withdraw their investments for food and rent money
172Im redeeming my 1-day bear pass to tendie town this AM RIP call holders
173I literally bought at the top because I thought shit this market just wont stop going up so I might as well get in on it then my calls dropped 50 in value yesterday and my account is destroyed
174They say q3 is fucked if we dont crash  then we will never go down again
175Why do people beg for dips so they can buy calls and then panic when we go slightly red AMZN 7/17 3300c
176Cant have 2 red days in a row its science
177You guys are all gay
178People can rationalize reasons for the market being up all they want this is a fomo bubble Consider taking any profit and position accordingly  If we do start crashing expect another round of stimulus to both prop us up and to win votes for our useless politicians on both sides re-election campaigns
179Where is JA RULE to make some sense of all this I dont wanna dance Im scared to death
180One of you bears come rim my butthole
181Dont forget to buy puts at open when were red That method is full proof 
182RIP Grant Imahara no wonder the markets crashing today Fuck this shit

212Hedge funds in the future Id like to manage one Shrek Dildo CapitalGet us on CNBC smashing wine coolers and strut in wearing spandex suitsListen Anderson  thats a fucking boomer stock  if we wanted to name our firm  scared chicken shit old man fund we would have done that
213Amzn tanking on awesome earnings beat in the middle of a global-wide pandemic-fueled financial collapse is exactly the type of pleb-fuckening that wall street is famous for
214Sometimes when Im casually browsing reddit I still think Im on wsb I proceed to yell obscenities and call people retards and autists before realizing Im in the wrong sub
215I hate when you sell a position that ends up increasing in value as soon as you sell it and I hate holding positions that end up tanking or going flat when you decide to holdHappened twice this week with TSLASold early for a 500 gain that would have been a 1000 gain And yesterday I had a call that was up 500 and I decided to hold because of my previous experience and now its down -2 lol Truly living in a simulation Fucking spooky

300Banks made record earnings in their investment branches? Sell your calls at open because thats bearish It falsifies the narrative of money waiting on the sidelines They were in the rally since april and took profits at the top
301Honestly tired of the retards on this sub but theres also a ton of useful information sprinkled everywhere so its hard to just stop coming here
302The year is 2058 For 38 years SPY has vacillated between 300 and 320 As you stare off into the distance you feel a tug at your sleeve Its your grandson Grandpa can you tell me about Bulls and Bears again?  Before you can answer his mother chimes in Oh honey dont fall for your grandfathers tall tales   You smile at the boy and nod at his mothers wisdom Of course theres no such thing as Bulls or Bears just as theres no such thing as Unicorns  The boy shrugs suddenly bored and returns to playing with his stuffed animals a massive pile of toy kangaroos grotesquely inserting limbs into each others pouches like the foreplay at a massive orgy A quiet rage flares behind your eyes then fades to sadness          Yes I posted this before but Ill post it in every thread until its untrue at market close
303You can sense allThe bears in the comments
304Bull or bear may today be interesting 
305Gonna finish red again today Bear Gang is in this bitch Big beautiful pump fake this morning

338Lets do that thing where SPY drops 3 in 5 mins like earlier Lol I was watching AMZN and bruh at one point one of the ticks was a 50 drop on the way down
339So somehow we gonna ignore second lockdown as we ignored second wave too ? Yesterdays sell off will mean almost nothing than a sweet dip to buy if we close 05 green today
340Since TSLA hasnt explosively dumped yet I think its got gas in the tank for another ATH
341I guess March sell off happened because we were caught off guard by the china virus Then the whole support system sprung into enormous and overwhelming action worldwide making an overkill liquidity pouring into markets This is why even if we get bad news anymore we drop like 1-2 and then it gets bought back to push it to higher end of the range This mitti paint a grim picture in long term we might experience something like Japan worldwide But this is not a good environment to be a short term bear especially if you are buyer of options
342These red candles above 317 big money dumping bags

400This is the gayest green day ever
401A red market means a mad Trump This pleases me Deploy Drill Team 6
402TSLA SWINGS TO LOSS ON MUSK 800 MILLION STOCK AWARD EXPENSEInsiders know TSLA will have loss due to required expensing of Musk 800 million stock award  Its a non-cash expense but it has to be deducted   The resulting loss will disqualify TSLA from S&P inclusion it needs 4 consecutive quarters of net income this quarter would have been the 4th    The run up is the result of speculation of inclusion in S&P which will eventually result in a lot of buying by ETFs most investors buy ETFs which have over one trillion in assets vs stocks  Unfortunately this wont happen despite TSLA crushing it with 90000 deliveries   I have owned the stock at 290 and wont sell because eventually it will be at  5k but I have puts to protect myself after the loss is reported on July 22nd  I think this run up has been far too swift and it speculative
403California shuts down again and tanks the marketpeople are scared of another shutdowntech is drilling and travel stocks are mooningWhat is this opposite day shit?

559Went from 15000 to 19500 on my Robinguh Monday before the bears fucked me 6200 now I finally feel like Im apart of this group
560The thing about a gap up like this is that theres generally continuation SPY futures  The move to 319 looked like a gap fill to me which it was  The price bounced pretty good and set a higher low from thereThis is nothing but super bullish from a technical perspective  Price hit 323 pulled back hard hit 323ish resistance again pulled back a bit less and then gapped up last night with futures  Crazy bullish TAI would suspect that SPY ATH is the next real resistance but this market is absolutely fucked  It could very well be here when you add in a new black swan everyday  I think the cheap interest rates and surge of retail interest is driving a melt up  Add leverage in the form of the popularity of options and you have volatility with some firepower behind the retail side  Im generally wrong but this is just what Im thinking despite a lot of bearish sentiment tonight

828I got restricted by schwab because i entered a debit spread and i only had level 1 options approval Level 2 is what enables spreads I held the spread for an entire week before and then out of no where today schwab restricted my account and forcefully sold the spread at a large lossI made a mistake buying the spread in the first place but i am curious as to why there is 0 warning or barrier to prevent you from making trades that the broker itself is claiming to not allow you to make? It is just a little suspicious the position exit costed me an abhorrent 60 in commission for no reasonI am not saying i didnt fuck up i am just shocked that robinhood has more mitigatory/preventative measures for options trading mistakes than a company that has existed for 50 yearsAlso curious had i made the spread through two separate trades rather than buying and selling at the same time would it even be recognized as a spread by Schwab?

870If VIX gonna keep dropping on red days how am I supposed to use it as a hedge? 
871Is it possible that to shake out newbie investors MMs/hedge funds just look for high volume options activity then move the price to inverse it? Like if they see that a bunch of tards are buying puts on company X they pump it up and if tards are buying calls on company Y they tank it?

947Teslas TSLA 001 market capitalization is nearing 300 billion Its now the largest car maker in the world even larger than Toyota Motor Corp TM 045 which produced almost 9 million cars in 2019 and has a market capitalization of around 175 billionTesla stock is trading at 45 times very rosy  and improbable  2024 earnings Teslas market cap implies that investors believe that production will go up more than 20-fold from the 400000 cars a year it currently produces to 10 million carsBondholders take a decidedly different view of Tesla As the stock-market valuation of Tesla races to the moon its debt rating is earthbound Tesla the worlds largest automaker gets a Caa1 rating from Moodys Investors Service for its senior unsecured debt while S&P Global gives Tesla a B- credit rating Put simply Teslas bonds are considered junk

981Hopefully AZN pumps the whole market on Monday with good vaccines news I just need AZN to hit 65 and Amazon 3050 and I will be a really happy person And I will be converting back to a bear
982If spy hits ath next week Im rich if it drops Im broke what a thrill
983Help me understand volatility being just off its low since corona Im a bull because JPOW printer brrrrr inflation etc But consider this - vaccine pumps obviously super fake - unemployment numbers horrible- no clear outlook on economic recovery with states pausing reopening- recovery stocks in the shitter even with vaccine pump- unemployment 600 may not get extendedTech at ATH makes sense but is the market so confident in earnings that theyre not hedging?  In the past two days- Netflix tanked at earnings- Cloudflare broke the Internet- Twitter hackedIm dont understand the way the market is pricing the risk/volatility The most confusing is vaccine companies pumping and recovery stocks dead The market is saying well be vaccinated but never leave the house again so we can play with our tech toys If thats the case can we at least get a decent sex robot jfcSPY 325c 7/24SPY 340c 8/21 SPY 322c 9/18QQQ 270c 7/24DKNG 40c 8/21PLAY 15c 1/21/22VXX 315c 8/7
984I might be blowing my account here but Elon just tweeted the following Will those who write algorithms ever realize their negativity bias?Today TSLA closed exactly 020 over its open Is he telling me personally that the price is being artificially choked by algos and its too negative for earnings?He then shared a meme about Dodgecoin which I dont believe has anything to actually do with DodgecoinAm I going to be rich as fuck or am I only poor and autistic?Edit Im going to be rich as fukBears are also fuk

1005Bull or bear up or down MSFT is garbage
1006If AZN vaccine fails SPY drills if it passes SPY moonsRegardless of the result just buy calls you dumb bears
1007Official explanation according to the Fed  \Whats happened is that with the partial closure of the economy the flow of coins through the economy has gotten all  its kind of stopped Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said during a virtual hearing with the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday  \Thats because the supply chain that coins usually flow through has been interrupted during the pandemic Powell said  \Banks and businesses have shuttered or changed the way they operate And so there are fewer coins reaching the public  That explanation seems very amateurish - no other countries including those with similar lockdowns are currently experiencing coin shortages - its only the US Why is that?  One theory is that the Fed is trying to frantically retrieve the circulating coinage due to its metal value to prevent hoarding This seems to suggest that the USD spot price for Cu or Ni and possibly Zn will double in the near future and with ongoing inflation due to bailouts and stimulus that might be likely  Right now the US 5-cent Nickel 75 Cu is the closest in worth when you compare metal to face value melting one today would net you 00409 If the copper metal price trend continues on the current trajectory it will reach 420 USD/lb around Nov 2020 to Feb 2021 at which point it will become profitable to melt 5-cent pieces  The very fact that theyre recalling coinage and passing it off as a logistics problem suggests that a they dont want you to hoard coins and b they expect the dollar to tank in the near future  Does this sound rational or do I need to take my meds?
1008Any bears have advice on how to eat shit? Got a steaming pile in my portfolio and might have to eat it soon

1032WSB can be very useful 2 days ago while managing positions I refreshed the WSB discussion page and read a comment lamenting about how they chose the wrong day to buy silver calls I saw it was down -2 and remembered that i was expecting a dip in the metals 7/16 followed by a short term run up so i bought calls on PAAS one of my favorite miners and flipped it the next day for 70 Decent playUnfortunately as of late there have been alot of newcomers spamming so I may have to block a couple hundred people to weed out the trash and keep the gold on my feed I suggest you do the same

1041Anyone else thinking Monday might be the biggest trading day since COVID started?

1048Its not a matter of if a stimulus passes its just what the size and content of that package looks likeMarket this time will react negatively to everything  where it acted positively in past few monthsMarket realized there is no easy fix for this recessionIn 2008 there were bankruptcies but businesses were open and people were going out and spending travelling  no trade war no borders were closed schools were open  But in 2020 current recession gloabally economies are shut busineses are closed even schools are closed  borders are closed huge unemployment for long time to come and people are scared to go out and spend Airlines laying off people trade war with China covid cases still rising bankruptcy going to rise as work from home going to be part of life so there will be huge shrinkage of economy for extended period of time and unlimited trillion of debt cant fix these issuesBet safely

1054Pretty obvious NKLA is ripe with corruption and insider trading Stock coincidentally drops 7 on good news of them breaking ground on factory and then stock offering is announced AH This POS is in the fast lane to the fkn pink sheets lol
1055Rug pull might not be a sudden drop but a slow gradual decline   AMZN has been telling this week
1056NKLA dropped because they introduced extra shares right?
1057If I was looking for a way to confirm my bearish bias into next week Id first look at volume/price and holy fuck There has been lots of selling and nothing but mindless algo dip buying since Wednesday Smells of dump I was wrong about today but I am often 1-2 days early on my hunch plays Put the rest of my account on 7/22 314 puts for 83/pop This is it boys If Im wrong Im done

1061The ol sell puts/put credit spreads on NKLA crowd is getting fucked right now
1062Lost 30 on a SPY put AZN calls should be making that back and then someRetired  here
1063My prediction is that AMZN will have a run up before earnings but thats after AMZN drops another 5-10 So itll drop to maybe 2600-2800 and then earnings run up will bring it back to 3000 Probably not what you wanted to hear but sir this is a Wendys
1064GEX flipped this week for AMZN when it around 2940sfor 7/24 expiry it flips near 2925 but it looks like MM has significantly reduced their gamma exposure vs last Fri and earlier this Monday so rest of the week itll be dependent on other big boi ERmax pain for 7/24 is 2975 and ER week of 7/31 is 2960 they really got rocked last Fri and Mon before it completely reversedIV is high as fuck vs historic right now for AMZN so shit is gonna be lit until ER plays out last time it was at these level? March lows March 12 to 20s this is when it had those -100 pt days every day and it looked like the market wont find a bottom anytime soon April ER week Apr 16 to 30 - when it broke out of its channel and shot up from 2000 to 2400 lost 15k in puts that period till i converted to call
1065Instead of vix calls for hedging on red days why dont people use vaccine stocks instead

1072Russia made a deal with AZN stating it was to be used ALONGSIDE their own vaccine For some reason they also claimed they did not hack AZN This makes me wonder could they have hacked other biotechs and discovered shit data and realized Oxfords results are really good and the most effective? Speculation of course I love bluebery
1073This week I learned how painful it was for bears to rip open my anus
1074Okay I figured out my big brain move this monthFlip my WMT call before August hopefully the stock jumps 5 by then so I can at least break even in itBuy 500 worth of 25c GNUS calls for august expiry cause the Position costs distribution on it is INSANE Like 70 of the shareholders are down 50 min and most are down 70-80 and still holding I see another retard dump since its been accumulating for a month and they just got a catalyst of a deal with Archie comics

1324I spent a few hours backtesting the performance volatility and volume of MCFT mastercraft boats over the past 8 MSFT ER days/weeks to see if there was any confusion among the tickers leading to increased unusual volume/vol on MCFT I plotted the daily data and measured in a few different ways I assigned a potential degree of correlation / confidence interval based on how many days before/after the ER date to identify unusual activity based on strong independent MSFT action I also looked at time of day activity and layered in market performance in general on those days and intraday to make sure I was not confusing correlation/causation I also looked at non ER days / outliers where MSFT had independent unusual activity to see if MCFT correlated on non-ER weeks It was a complete waste of time and I found no correlation whatsoever lol

1389Just encountered my first antimasker Dude was giving so much grief to a little 16 year old Spanish kid Trying to lecture him on his rights whats ridiculous and whats logical about coronavirus and generally making his case For real? Hes a fucking kid and likely has the least rank since hes the one they send to deal with the maskless people who insist on coming in he was stopped at the door where the line starts causing the line to form behind him Then stopped short of accusing this kid of being sketchy when he let out a big sigh of grief once he learned the kid had to take his card to the front Why? Fucking email corporate dont hold everyones day up and intimidate a child because youre too big of a sloppy fuck up to remember to bring a mask with you

1406the tides are turning bears about to come out of hibernation
1407Step 1 It takes a global pandemic for bears to actually make money in March They make a lot of money initially but then lose it all again trying to chase it all the way down to a SPY 200p that is doomed to never go ITM  Step 2 It takes trillions and trillions of continuous printing and stimulus for bulls to undo the bear market we are here  Step 3 A huge surge in cases and deaths in California Texas and Florida results in new stay at home orders Gold surges dollar crashes Powell keeps printing but it isnt enough to keep treasury yields from rising Theres a second leg down in the stock market Bulls in absolute shambles Bears make a lot of money initially but lose it all again foolishly chasing the mythical dragon that is SPY 200p  Step 4 A great vaccine comes out the pandemic is over and life returns to normal in 2021 A global recession happens anyway Now finally SPY will go under 200 but no bears will be solvent to profit from it
1408Ive got a lot of SPY 300 puts for 7/31 bought them for 040 each How cheap is that  That date covers the majority of earnings if spy drops to 295 by then its a 10 bagger Seems like a no brainer here

Theres 13 million people in this sub If we average that out to 10k per account thats 13 billion dollars 200 billion is traded daily on NYSE Theoretically WSB could make up 65 of the market daily If we all banded together to run spy up to 325 and then dump it back down to 300 the next day we would fuck the entire market Making it impossible for big money to keep control of the market We could turn the tables and take money from those fuck heads Leaving us to make fat sacks of tendies I mean everyone can dream right?

1512Saw all the Microsoft posts so went and looked at the chart thinking it was going to be horrific WTF it dropped 70 cents This thread is pathetic sometimes I swear
1513So let me get this straight We used to measure a companys success based on its earnings But then someone said lets start pumping a bunch of expectations analysis And that analysis is always magically set a bit lower than what earnings will be so then the stock can moon for beating expectations--and no careful criticism of the actual earning numbers is considered? You bulls are genius I gotta say
1514Just got my negative results back for covid a week later Now my chest and throat hurt and ive got a cough and body achesI feel like death going back to get tested againIf I die its for you bears
1515Azn drops on good news If they cured cancer we would drop 90
1516this is where were at watch  Tesla beats earnings today makes it into the S&P hype pushes it to 330 tomorrow  Tesla shits the bed does NOT make it into the S&P nosedives for a little tech crashes temporarily as sentiment lowers spy comes back to earth  Take your pick
1517Things I personallynot saying right learned in 4 months trading options to earn consistent profitBuy ATMBig companies\40 days expiryflip em within 7-10 daysCredit spreads mostly useless theta gang fake and gay urban mythThe most important onewhen computer start whirring all fans going and market going down do not hold If you hear the fan start up fold

1555So is this an AMD pump and dump? This is some ridiculous volume compared to normal
1556As much as the market looks like it is going to crash imminently it has looked like this every day in the morning feel like buying calls into a bad spot
1557Is holding one TSLA share through earnings make me a bear?
1558elon tweeted a bear emoji what else do yall need to know
1559Despite all the indicators every time Ive started a short-term bearish position it has not played out and just buying calls would have made money  Every time I thought this is the time it will be different Here I am thinking the same way but also thinking I should inverse myself and just buy more calls
1560Looks like Im switching to short term bear gangGet ready for ATH
1561There is not a more illegal crime in this country than SPY being red
1562stonks usually seem to drop for a week straight after i buy calls on them hmmm
1563wish cnbc would replace their usual push notifications with either bulls r fuk or bears r fuk depending on whether spy is red or green
1564Robinhood charts are manipulated to make the smallest drop/gain look massive so u buy/sell lmao
1565Oh cool a spike checks volume Nope Still fake and gay
1566People really think if they type EOD pump incoming or EOD dump incoming itll just happen as if these things are spoken into existence by reddit users
1567Ok we have power hour Trump presser in 20-30 minutes  and right when he finishes tanking the market TSLA numbers come out ouuff intense
1568msft neckbeards uniteto the fxcking  bull gates show us your cock
1569Im too scared to buy Microsoft calls and too poor for tesla calls So whoever is holding any of those Good luck I hope u make it to tendie heaven
1570TSLA could beat earnings and still make people realize it is overpriced and crash down
1571Really wishing the best to everyone with a stake in MSFT or TSLA Oh except the bears Fuck you guys
157210 mins til bears or bulls are fcked by Tesla
1573bear gang idk whats gonna happen but its been an honor serving with yall
1574MSFT just dropped to 207 oh dear
1575People waking up now have no idea how futures dropped like hell at 330am because of the Chinese embassy and Alaska tsunami shitFutures are fake
1576Do people forget that yesTSLA is indeed more than an auto companyElon Musk is a fucking genius and has been involved with umpteen successful companiesAnd has been toying with bears for weeksAnd is on the verge of announcing a profitable quarter during a pandemicTSLA 2000 EOW
1577lol now its CNBCs fault that he intentionally tanked the market so he could go long
1578Since the crash only 4 days have had 10Y yields below 6
1579any time I try to balance out a bullish trade with a bearish one they just both end up going in the wrong direction 
1580tech cant really tank can it? techs like the entire economy
1581Puts calls Shares All red always
1582I am so tired of taking it up the ass minutes after placing an options trade Like they are literally waiting for me before dumping/pumping
1583Early morningBears limit down market crash silver is up end is nighNowBears boring damn vaccine pump
1584Amazon stop being gay please you ruining me
1585Its so bearish in here QQQ down 17 and SPY up 05 Bears going to buy the bottom again Theyll never learn
1586Mamma Lisa Su take me to green pastures where the tendies roam and the bulls frolic and bears can get killed by the electric fence
158710-year sub 6Crude droppingVIX upIf we get a EOD FUCK YOU pump Imma be pissed
1588Market is more predictable then the virgin mary when she cheated on Joseph with the village Chad
1589AMD was the ultimate long-con Trade within a few dollar range let options get stupid cheap drop the IV then pump that shit up Shake the weak hands for 5 months then profit My god
1590God this Tesla drop is going to be historical
1591SPY not allowed red wtf is this
1592I merely have one requeston my tombstone place murdered by Su bae I never shouldve doubted youlet my death not be in vain and serve as a warning to others
1593Which one of you autists made this meme? https//wwwredditcom/r/Portland/comments/hvxw4j/portland\right\now/https//wwwredditcom/r/Portland/comments/hvxw4j/portlandrightnow/&x200Byou owe me a new keyboard as Ive spit coffee all over it
1594I dont even have a play on MSFT or TSLA tonight and im still scared
1595I like how the tesla bears are saying what goes up must come down bruh this shit isnt affected by the laws of gravity its a stock price not a balloon
1596Today is so fake and gay
1597true story  i ordered a dildo on ebay it said discreet packaging  i went to pick it up from receptionist this morning and its a 9 inch slender box w a dildo flopping around inside  couldnt be more obvioustime to look for a new apartment
1598Never be scared to cut losses Sometimes youre just fucking retarded and need to realize that in order to not lose even more money
1599MSFT beating and dropping still tells you all you need to know about how overbought tech is its not the first to beat and still drop Beats are already priced in there is very little upside to be had from these earnings calls this quarter
1600Doesnt matter how good the earnings are shit gonna crash regardless No earning is gonna justify how high some of these stocks are
1601Bears unite for a prayer circle  Give me a solid -2-3 red dayHow many are at Uncut Gems level of stress?
1602Lol CNBC clowning this ackman guy for being a gay bear 
1603Silver is tanker gang 20
1604Who thinks MSFT and TSLA are gonna tank after earnings like NFLX?
1605Seriously mods we need to ban this guy immediatelyhttps//wwwredditcom/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hvuyuv/psatltgovbuyat12pmtodayresistancebreak/?utmsourceshare&utmmediumiosapp&utmnameiossmf go look at TLT just now
1606Almost every index in the world is red today
1607When the chadsdaq moons today I demand that all bears bend the knee and accept their bull overlords
1608Im stoned as fuck on edibles and cant sleep Heres my prediction PFE up TSLA downAm genius
1609Is silver the new tanker gang?
1610AMZN gonna do that pump fake - up 15-20 pm then drop 40 at open   You would think by now I would play it better during the day
1611DXY dip below 95 and 10 yr below 60 Something is about to break Whales have placed their betsEdit Dollar crash money go to safe heaven 10yr treasury It also explains why Silver went up so much yesterday and today
1612Metals exploding 10-Y near crash lows and now some Gyna shit Be careful with those longs boys Not necessarily saying buy puts but it might be cash gangs time to shine
1613Shittttt Ackman probably sold all the tech he was holding went long into all the beaten down stuff and is chillin now Ready to reload with 20-30 cash for any further drops
1614Feeling bearish SPY 320s and gonna grab more lotto TSLA 1000s today lets rain
1615Back to the good ol days where Dow and S&P are red and nazzy is greens
1616Wish you guys were here last night when Elon dropped this tweethttps//twittercom/elonmusk/status/1285816082045865985?s21  never seen a sub go from bearish to bullish so fast
1617Gonna open down a bunch of hundreds thanks AZN
1618Looking like a red day today
1619Time for SPY to fill that gap up to 33250  Pipers always got to be paid bears
1620I figured AMD was going to do its dip thing again so I held puts Well shit
1621Whats the AMD news?Just when I decide to sell covered calls 
1622My amd puts are crumbling to dust but but but it always tanks after hitting 57 why is is above 60 now
1623Remember when any report about US/China tensions would tank or moon the market?Now its completely ignored 1000 people die in a day from COVID and market doesnt bat an eye lol Strange times
1624getting the feeling tesla will drop like a rock after earnings
1625USD crashing is the scariest thing happening right now Imagine all the foreign dollars we exported come flooding back at once
1626Stuff is slowing down at work Ya boi might get laid off in the next workforce reduction
1627I discovered the perpetual motion of options by inversing yourselfWhen you have calls buy puts so the stock moonsWhen you have puts buy calls so the stock tanksThe market wont know which way to go to dick you200 IQ Stonks /s
1628Surely it takes hundreds of billions of dollars to move silver a few percent? There must be some serious money flowing into commodities but the market doesnt want to tank either
1629Tech bears trembling at the sight of Su Bae and AMD
1630Silver/gold is priced globally It wont crash because RH users trash it or MM decides to steal your tendies If the dollar keeps crashing like this and uncertainty continues to reign cross global markets its destined to reach ATH folks
1631I think TSLA would tank but Im not confident enough to bet against ElonEdit Im genuinely scared to buy puts on TSLA
163214 straight red candles on QQQ but we still positiveTHANK U POWELL 3
1633TSLA is so unpredictable
1634SPY about to tank
1635Idk why but I feel bulls and bears and straddles are all gonna lose in TSLA today this just somehow seems to be a day for the theta leeches and their fucking implied volatility
1636My dumbass was up 3K earlier exited puts waited for the pump then reentered thinking I was a genius since puts were cheaper and now Im only up 84 from this stupid ass sideways shit Bitch ass theta
1637Alright boys I caved in and bought the 1000P for friday at 2 bucks Scared money dont make none
1638Been holding MSFT 210cs since July 8th  I single handedly hold the power to crash the market at any moment  Youve been warned
1639At this point I think a big drop would be great for bulls so we have more room to rally
1640Yall ever get so stressed that you just feel tired Fried out is an accurate term Feels like every nerve in your body is just exhausted
1641Introducing the new SPY Shake-O-Matic 500 Tired of all those diamond hands trying to hold on for gains? Well not anymore SPY now has twice the retarded swings intraday as before and half of the previous gain porn by retards MMs give it two thumbs up
1642Tomorrow will be bigly red
1643I feel like volume and red candles comin for power hour again
1644Spy red I lose Spy green I lose Yet I dont feel like quitting
1645Looks like last year SPY dropped 6 percent and QQQ dropped 5 percent for the month of August  Will that happen this year?
1646Trading options is wild Ive made half of my years salary in since July 13th Military pay sucks Then fluctuations in your account on a daily bases I think I have a gambling problem when 5k swings dont make me quit Like started out today down 2k then amazon and shop tanked went from down 2k to up 3K then exited positions and re entered gambling problem and went to 84 up for the day now back at 12k for day Once I hit 100k Im out Only 76K more to go
1647well my TSLA 1000 put is gaining faster than my 3000 call so I guess im rooting for an earnings tank
1648At least bears get to taste victory each day even if its only from 9pm-6am Very considerate of the market to toss some scraps on the ground each night before raiding their fridges and training their wives
1649SPY will moon when TSLA murders earningsIf MSFT also smashes earnings w azure then this sub will explode and the gay bears will be eradicated once and for all
1650Holy motherfucker its all tanking
1651Sold my MSFT calls for a nice profit Dont trust this gay stock to not do something retarded AH
1652Today was a no-move day sideways all day because tesla and msft earnings will dictate the sentiment of tech upon which everyone trades the rest of the week Itll be very interesting to see what happens if tesla bears earnings If they pop off their current highs of the last 3 mo thats a huge shock and signifies a huge willingness to ratchet up risk through 2020 If they remain flat and merely fill their big shoes the market will likely be pretty flat going forward and you can expect overall volatility of the markets to decrease substantially Either will be fun for the markets its a return to normalcy or a continuance of the lunacy of 2020 valuations Ive got long term options and shares of everything hedged by short term QQQ puts so idgaf either way Im hedged for whatever
1653Trump better say hes outlawing all gas powered cars in his presser
1654I think ive read here that TSLA needs to have a positive eps to be considered forSP500 inclusion is that correct?
1655Holy shit I barely have 200 in Tesla options & im nervous asf Imagine the tards with hundreds of thousands
1656TSLA Short squeeze to roast all the bears for dinner time 
1657You know were truly in a delusional bubble when the Nasdaq isnt even red from China saying theyre going to fucking retaliate against us  I guess everyone forgot when we crashed 30 last year just because of slight trade war tensions with them that actually never were even resolved just ignored?
1658starting to think maybe i shouldve bought silver instead of one hundred SPY 7/24 390cs 
1659Fuck all you bearsTSLA 2500 EOW
1660Way I figure it if TSLA beats and has positive earnings guaranteeing their inclusion in SPY market will tank the stock because the good news was priced in and for no reason at all people will decide now is the time to believe it is overpricedIf TSLA misses or beats but is still negative market will moon the stock because of optimism that theyll get it right in the next four quarters
1661TSLA 1700 after earnings Amzn 3400 These are my predictions based off emotion and no technicals at all
1662Everything Ive lost in the past few days has felt like a super high interest loan I borrowed a few hundred and they came for 700
1663SPCE will have incredible gains by end of the month
1664Before hurr durr perma bear comments I dont trade TSLA at all Never had it in my portfolio and never will haveThat being said I am looking at insider tradings within TSLA out of boredomCFO of TSLA sold 250 shares on July 21 https//wwwsecgov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000177136420000012/xslF345X03/edgardocxmlhttps//wwwsecgov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000177136420000012/xslF345X03/edgardocxmlSVP of TSLA sold 300 shares on July 14 https//wwwsecgov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000179056520000008/xslF345X03/edgardocxmlhttps//wwwsecgov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000179056520000008/xslF345X03/edgardocxmlPresident Automotive of TSLA sold 3000 shares on July 1 https//wwwsecgov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000158451820000008/xslF345X03/edgardocxmlhttps//wwwsecgov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000158451820000008/xslF345X03/edgardocxmlThose are very small numbers though compared to what they are holding Do what you want with this infoMy positions Long GDX GDXJ SIL SILJ and EUR/USD
1665IBM beat faded Texas Instruments beat faded Im pretty sure iRobot beat and faded Netflix and Snap missed and theyre coming back Someone mentioned last MSFT earnings they beat and were up bigly AH only to open flat / slightly red I really want to hold these calls but Idk
1666Fake and gay rally over the last few months just feel like its going to end real soonIf today somehow is green I will go to 20 cash in 401k
1667MSFT and AMZN do predatory pricing on cloud
1668Im getting a little scared not gonna lie
1669Support for a China war would drop as soon as Americans realize they wont get their new iPhones
1670I wouldve thought US and China beefing over IP would cause a larger drop in premarket
1671Hopefully todays the day people realize spce is not spacex and it tanks My slow crawl back to breakeven has begun
1672Today is stupid and gay and I give up
1673Making more money on gay stuff like gold silver and bond etfs right now than stocks Gay
1674My portfolio is red light green light red light green light red light green light
1675AMD literally hit 5999 before dropping Loooool

1679People cant handle 027 red on NASDAQ Terrifying
1680MSFT has been trading between 212 and 209 since Monday at 10AM People panicking when it drops to 209 lol Zoom out
1681What is going on with the stimulus shit?   Seems like congress is gonna drop the ball   Might be time for spy puts
1682My screen time during the week has gone up exponentially since I discovered this place lol
1683can we just drop and get it over with my god
1684i am stupidly guessing this next drop is the good one
1685Theta Gang and this flatness remind me too much of the general malaise and boredom that is my life during quarantine This is supposed to be my escape now its just as boring as everything else
1686So is Elon saying to be bearish cause its part of the best meme or bullish because being bearish is the meme
1687Even if SPY is up today it still feels very bearish because of whats happening with precious metals Seems like something is brewing
1688I started buying calls and put credit spreads and now my whole account is this weird colordid RH update their UI to a green color???
1689I feel sick I just bought my first put in nearly 2 months Why did I cave into a little China bs Idk how bears do it
1690God think about how illiquid the options would be You would need over 6 million in collateral for any cash covered put you sell ATM

1868Show me on the SPY where the bear touched you
1869This market is so ass-backwards Intel tanking is not necessarily good for AMD I guess people assuming if Intel bad AMD good But given the market Intel being bad most likely means AMD will be worse
1870Round 2 of stock taking and profit taking happens today US/China are fucked Brexit/UK is fucked no decision in July as previously expected EU 750bn fund impacting bond yields Oil stuck at 42 and not moving US employment stalling 13m additional claims Covid owning dumb US states Asia traded sideways Fund managers identify were reaching a cliff edge in stocks 600 free cash in the post ends next weekYeh if today aint a red day then red days dont exist
1871Didnt MSFT exceed their Q2 projections by 2bill yet theyre red today??makes sense
1872Please stop the drilling Im sorry bears I take back the disgusting amount of disrespect Ive given you for a month
1873we dropped like 1 on SPY and you guys are panicking I wonder what will happen on 5 days
1874This looks like a bear flag on the daily
1875I think Fed is screwed The market keep pricing in unrealistic inflation like stocks never go down Look at USD it keep crashing It will eventually force Fed to take a dramatic turn on easing The market is pricing in negative rate yield control major policy shift in fedthis one seems confirmed by bloomberg but fed hasnt confirm it The world is panicking fleeing from dollar it explains why silvers went up like crazy If this continue a couple of wks u will see price stuff in dollar term will go up fed will forced to punish the market or it will cause a fake inflation in a already deflationary economy so its stagflation which will make this recession even worse Look at USD and 10yr and gold/silver USD crash  equity goes up in similar pace but it didnt USD never crash this fast 10yr yield plummet like shit money going into 10yr means ppl expecting fed will implement yield control and negative rateeven the fed denied this one they are frontrunning the fed the market is front running the fed into a corner they dont think the fed can let the rate raise again consider the current deficit and debtload of country and corporations market wont listen even the fed denied those inflation policy eg market keep pricing in negative rate when fed officially denied Fed will force to stop easing when every1 jack up their price in a deflationary economy its understandable for market to place in such crazy inflation bets considering fed already buying bonds for govt and public companies Keep ur eyes on USD if it keep plummeting in the same pace for a few more days or to 2wks a sell off will happen fed will forced to do something to the marketEdit My reasoning is actually based on todays insanity of the market the monster created by fed will eat the fed alive the only way to stop the market is to crash the market by destroy their fantasy of a fake inflation if my theory is right fed will reverse easing at a very quick manner to give a market the msg in next few wks which is exactly what happened in 1987 yes 1987 market crash is very real the only difference is this time fed is tightening to fight a fake inflation which is already spiraling out of control Tech will crash if Fed is forced to curl inflation Hot money will rotate out from techs Techs raise both bad and good news bcz the inflation prediction bad news fed will keep brrrr inflation drive investors into techs so is pandemic good news inflation will run hotter Only when fed forced their hands to fight inflation tech will go burstIf my reasoning make you hard please give me a gold Thanks
1876Round 2 of stock taking and profit taking happens today  US/China are fucked Brexit/UK is fucked no decision in July as previously expected EU 750bn fund impacting bond yields Oil stuck at 42 and not moving US employment stalling 14m additional claims initial claims are UP for first time since March Covid owning dumb US states Asia traded sideways Fund managers identify were reaching a cliff edge in stocks 600 free cash in the post ends next week NO TAX CUT FOR businesses in next stimulus bill FUCCKEDYeh if today aint a red day then red days dont exist

1883Buying spy calls at open youre welcome bears
1884If we really drop our unemployment bump down from 2400/month to 400/month we will have shit hit the fan But if we can find a way to slowly drop it every month I think we will have much more success Hopefully congress pulls its head out of its ass the economic impact of 20 of the workforce being laid off and not having any income is going to cause way more damage than giving them more money at this point im gay
1885Wanna feel like a genius? Go read /r/investing posts like this onehttps//redditcom/r/investing/comments/hv40im/waitingonthesidelines/

1891Ive realized these bull nutz are about to Bear this fruit Get out while you can Shit talk me all you want  Ive been a bull on this shit for 2 years and this bubble is deflating and going to pop We all will pay for this inflation/national debt/stimulus money in the coming 3 years The market/economy was not GREAT it was a fucking bubble of inflation and low interest rates There will be another Green Day or 10 or 20 before the collapse but it is coming Pull out before the election Take a break Reinvest in big tech after the crash
1892The markets no longer have much of anything to do with the real economy A handful of companies that make up Americas oligopoly and the Feds balance sheet now determine market performance The fed works for the markets now The fed must do whatever the markets want or risk a crash The markets are too big to crash The fed is the markets bitch now
1893Fucking wild to see TSLA 07/24 calls that are 300 dollars ITM and STILL be red

1910Everyone is watching the dollar You should too If we dont rally off the lows here we could see a severe drop very suddenly This is a turning point for the market Either we hold this level or we plunge I havent bought puts in months Im long SLV and short QQQ
1911The dollar crashing is good for SPY obviously but when the 10 bagger purchases a single bag of doritos it wont really matter
1912With how wrong people are everytime they correlate SPY and VIX Im starting to think you guys are no better at predicting the markets than astrology
1913In the paper shredder
1914They know its ganna tank and need new bag holders These people are scammers
1915Discord and subreddit mods are different the discord is usually just retarded spam anyway In here at least we get a little bit of lulz
1916Be meBuy TSLA puts at 1600 before earningsWatch it drop to 1500 and still be down 50Sell at 359 yesterdayWatch it touch 1400 pre market
1917Can we appreciate the fact that 90 percent of the comments arent bulls are fuk or bears are Fuk 
1918Shouldve known I would have single handedly tanked MSFT when I cancelled my Xbox Live sub and still have yet to activate my windows license

1920In a few months time JPOW will fall from subreddit hero to subreddit villain
1921Dudes really out here with blood red portfolios Im dudes 
1922Try to remember that this is after a pretty solid red day Otherwise futures pump to 1 to erase such minor dips Today futures arent even going back to green Futures indicate the direction not extent Look at 10Y Chinese Markets etc If we dont get any big dick green news or vaccine pump today will be bad as weekend is incoming

1967Whats causing this dropMM worried that fed intervention will not likely continue given stimulus uncertainty USD looking like the Zimbabwe dollar Uncertainty in US-China relations The influx of retail traders make certain movements on stocks almost unpredictable but expect if we experience a Hang Seng day today that there will be a massive buy going into next week on stimulus hopes If you think yesterday and today were bad youre not ready for next Thursday
1968The more futures pump the more AMD drops I think people are selling AMD for quick profit and rotating into buying dips on AAPL AMZN etc? Gay but I would probably do it too

1989The expense of your salary is largely ignored during good times When the hard times roll around however your salary and bonus are viewed as the Achilles heel of the firm and the wholesale slaughter of lower-rung guys is de rigueur at the first hint of a missed quarterly targetJust about every employer will extol the virtue of teamwork tell you that theres no I in team and tell you that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link And Ill admit that there is value in pulling together with others - as long as theyre pulling in your direction But do yourself a favor and consider the sourceYoure An Unrestricted Free AgentIts time to quit thinking like an employee and start thinking like the CEO of You Inc In the game of life youre an unrestricted free agent What you do in this life is entirely up to you Maximize your personal profit If that means your objectives temporarily align with your employers so much the better But never forget that your objectives have to come firstDont feel guilty about pushing off that work boys Vice grip that market by the balls and take the power back for the sake of your family and your future

2011I think I finally figured out the market bought TSLA & AMZN puts at open and saw these bitches finally moving up so I took the 300 loss and bought calls like a man
2012made 60 on TSLA calls in 30 minutes and am out of day trades until next week gayboys
2013Good news I bought 61 AMD calls that expired today 2000 percent profitBad news I only bought two
2014Trump would let Xi throatfuck him before he let him tank the market

2017Dear JpowPlease let it drop to 319 today and I promise Ill never buy a put againSincerely
2018I think people are overestimating Amazon Their cash cow is AWS not their storefront Im sure they shipped a shit-ton more last quarter but their margins on the store have always been tiny compared to AWS Azure shrunk by 12 Since Azure is much newer then AWS it was growing at a much faster rate these last couple of years If Azure slowed then AWS definitely slowed down
2019The fact that the pumps are extra transparent and gay today feels really desperate like theyre pulling out all the stops to prevent a massive dump 0dte 319p

2035Jerome Powell said on APRIL 29TH that more stimulus from Congress would be needed to help the economy weather a downturn that is unlike anything certainly thats happened in my lifetime  It is now JULY 24TH and Congress is still whining and bitching about how much to spend Meanwhile J-Pow has been cranking and cranking that money printer and it seems to be less and less effective and his arms are getting very tired
2036This is why I love red days honestly Yes bulls may win most of the time but they get so cocky and obnoxious All it takes is one day like yesterday out of nowhere and especially two back to back like this and it completely wipes out everything theyve gained and some Its a beautiful sight
2037Is this what being in shambles feels like? Damn I cant imagine being a bear and feeling like this almost every day

2106Ive trash-talked extensively as both a bull and a bear and I can say with a high degree of confidence that its better to be a bull When I was a bear I used to think that all bulls were just cocky fucks always so smugbut then I realized that actually making money consistently does rightfully make you a bit cocky
2107Bulls our time has come For 3 months we prepared we grew stronger while you rested in your cradle of power  You were trusted to lead the republic but you were deceived as our powers of the dark side of the tendies have blinded you You assumed stonks always goes up and never down and now finally we have returned  You were deceived and now your calls shall fall
